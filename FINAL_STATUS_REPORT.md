**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 📋 Summary of Work Completed

### Original Request:
Implement two features for the LitmusAI platform:
1. **Course Recommendations in Dashboard** - Display personalized recommendations based on assessment results
2. **Save Assessment Results to User Profile** - Ensure all assessment data is persisted to database

### Additional Issues Fixed:
3. **Assessment Submission Error** - Fixed database schema issue
4. **Dashboard Loading Error** - Fixed missing import

---

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Assessment Submission Error

**Problem:**
```
Failed to submit assessment. Please try again.
```

**Root Cause:**
Database missing `domain_scores` column in `assessment_result` table.

**Solution:**
- Created migration script: `backend/fix_assessment_schema.py`
- Added `domain_scores` column to database
- Restarted backend server

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

### Issue 2: Dashboard Loading Error

**Problem:**
Dashboard not loading properly or showing errors.

**Root Cause:**
Missing `Lock` icon import in `DashboardPage.jsx` causing JavaScript error when rendering premium course badges.

**Solution:**
- Added `Lock` to imports from `lucide-react`
- Updated `src/pages/DashboardPage.jsx`

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## ✅ Features Implemented

### Feature 1: Course Recommendations in Dashboard

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Created `/api/assessment/recommendations` endpoint

- ✅ Added domain mapping system to training modules
- ✅ Created "Recommended for You" section in dashboard
- ✅ Implemented priority badges (HIGH PRIORITY, RECOMMENDED)
- ✅ Added skill gap analysis and personalized reasons
- ✅ Linked courses to training module pages

**How It Works:**
1. User takes assessment
2. Backend analyzes domain scores
3. Identifies weak domains (< 50% correct)

- **General:** Continued learning recommendations

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

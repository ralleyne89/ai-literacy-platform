# üîç Dashboard Data Recovery Guide

## Current Situation

Your Stripe checkout is now working! ‚úÖ

However, your assessment results and training progress are not showing on the dashboard. This guide will help diagnose and fix the issue.

## üìã Step-by-Step Diagnostic Process

### **Step 1: Run the Dashboard Diagnostic Tool**

Visit: **https://litmusai.netlify.app/dashboard-debug.html**

This tool will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Check if Supabase environment variables are set
- ‚úÖ Test Supabase connection
- ‚úÖ Check if you're logged in
- ‚úÖ Query your assessment results
- ‚úÖ Query your training progress
- ‚úÖ Check if ANY data exists in the database

**What to do:**
1. Make sure you're logged in to the main app first
2. Visit the diagnostic page
3. It will auto-run all tests
4. **Copy the ENTIRE page output** (all test results)
5. Share it with me

---

### **Step 2: Check Browser Console on Dashboard Page**

1. Go to: **https://litmusai.netlify.app/dashboard**
2. Open DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Console tab
3. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Look for logs starting with `[Dashboard]`

**Expected logs if working correctly:**
```javascript
[Dashboard] Starting data fetch
[Dashboard] User: {id: "...", email: "..."}
[Dashboard] User ID: abc-123-def
[Dashboard] Supabase client: initialized
[Dashboard] Fetching assessment history for user: abc-123-def
[Dashboard] Assessment query result: {assessments: [...], assessmentError: null}
[Dashboard] Assessments fetched: 5 records
[Dashboard] Fetching training progress for user: abc-123-def
[Dashboard] Training progress fetched: 3 records
```

**If Supabase not initialized:**
```javascript
[Dashboard] Supabase client: NOT initialized
[Dashboard] Check VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY environment variables
```

**If no data found:**
```javascript
[Dashboard] Assessments fetched: 0 records
[Dashboard] Training progress fetched: 0 records
```

**Copy ALL the `[Dashboard]` logs and share them.**

## üîç Possible Scenarios and Solutions

### **Scenario A: Environment Variables Not Set**

**Symptoms:**
- Dashboard diagnostic shows: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL: NOT SET ‚ùå`
- Console shows: `Supabase client: NOT initialized`

**Solution:**
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/litmusai/configuration/env
2. Add these environment variables:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` = `https://sybctfhasyazoryzxjcg.supabase.co`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InN5YmN0Zmhhc3lhem9yeXp4amNnIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTk0MjcwODUsImV4cCI6MjA3NTAwMzA4NX0.xycRoUaa1KIOUWLrlo--O4yoecT5eKo-jWy5DeLFQhI`
3. Trigger new deployment
4. Test again

---

### **Scenario B: Not Logged In**

**Symptoms:**
- Dashboard diagnostic shows: `Session: No active session ‚ö†Ô∏è`
- Console shows: `User: null` or `User ID: undefined`

**Solution:**
1. Go to: https://litmusai.netlify.app/login
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Return to dashboard
4. Data should appear

---

### **Scenario C: Logged In as Different User**

**Symptoms:**
- Dashboard diagnostic shows: `Records Found: 0`
- But database-wide check shows: `Total Assessment Records: 10+`
- Console shows a different User ID than expected

**Solution:**
1. Check the User ID in the diagnostic output
2. Compare it to the User ID you used when creating assessments
3. If different, you need to:
   - Log out
   - Log in with the correct account
   - Or migrate data to the new user ID

---

### **Scenario D: Data Never Created / Lost**

**Symptoms:**
- Dashboard diagnostic shows: `Records Found: 0`
- Database-wide check shows: `Total Assessment Records: 0`
- Console shows: `Assessments fetched: 0 records`

**This means the database is empty. Possible reasons:**

1. **Data was never created**
   - You never completed assessments in production
   - You only tested locally (local database ‚â† production database)

2. **Data was lost during migration**
   - Database was reset
   - Tables were dropped and recreated
   - Data migration failed

3. **Wrong database**
   - Connected to a different Supabase project
   - Using test database instead of production

**Solution:**
- If data was never created: Complete new assessments
- If data was lost: Check Supabase backups or recreate data
- If wrong database: Verify Supabase URL in environment variables

---

### **Scenario E: Row Level Security (RLS) Blocking Access**

**Symptoms:**
- Dashboard diagnostic shows: `Query failed: permission denied`
- Console shows: `assessmentError: {code: "42501", message: "permission denied"}`

**Solution:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to your project
3. Go to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Policies**
4. Check RLS policies on `assessment_results` and `user_progress` tables
5. Ensure policies allow users to read their own data:
   ```sql
   -- Policy should be something like:
   (auth.uid() = user_id)
   ```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Recovery Steps

### **If Data Exists But Not Showing:**

1. Check environment variables are set
2. Verify you're logged in
3. Verify User ID matches
4. Check RLS policies
5. Check for JavaScript errors in console

### **If Data Was Lost:**

1. **Check Supabase Backups:**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard
   - Check if backups exist
   - Restore from backup if available

2. **Recreate Data:**
   - Complete new assessments
   - Start new training modules
   - Data will be saved going forward

3. **Migrate from Local Database (if applicable):**
   - If you have data in local development
   - Export from local Supabase
   - Import to production Supabase

## üìä What to Share with Me

After running the diagnostic tool, please share:

1. **Full output from dashboard-debug.html**
   - All test results
   - Copy/paste or screenshot

2. **Console logs from dashboard page**
   - All `[Dashboard]` logs
   - Any error messages

3. **Answer these questions:**
   - Did you complete assessments in production or only locally?
   - Do you remember your User ID or email used for assessments?
   - When did you last see the data (approximate date)?
   - Did anything change recently (database migration, new deployment, etc.)?

## üéØ Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Run dashboard diagnostic tool
2. ‚úÖ Check browser console logs
3. ‚úÖ Share all results with me
4. ‚úÖ I'll analyze and provide specific fix

---

## üìù Important Notes

- **Production vs Local**: Local development uses a different database than production
- **User ID**: Data is tied to specific user IDs - must be logged in as the same user
- **RLS**: Supabase Row Level Security controls who can access data
- **Environment Variables**: Frontend needs `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

---

**Run the diagnostic tool and share the results. I'll provide a targeted fix based on what we find!** üöÄ

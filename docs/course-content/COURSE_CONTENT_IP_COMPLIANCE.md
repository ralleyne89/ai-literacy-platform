# Course Content IP Compliance Update

## Overview

This document explains the changes made to ensure the LitmusAI platform respects intellectual property rights and accurately represents course content.

## Issue Identified

The initial course content implementation used the name "Google AI Essentials" for internal course content, which could:
- Misrepresent third-party course content as our own
- Violate Google's intellectual property rights
- Confuse users about whether they're accessing the official Google course

## Official Google AI Essentials Course

**Official Course Details:**
- **Platform:** Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-essentials-google)
- **Also Available:** grow.google (https://grow.google/ai-essentials/)
- **Price:** $49 USD
- **Duration:** ~10 hours (self-paced)
- **Certificate:** Google AI Essentials Certificate upon completion
- **Content:** 5 modules covering:
  1. Introduction to AI
  2. Maximize Productivity With AI Tools
  3. Discover the Art of Prompting
  4. Use AI Responsibly
  5. Stay Ahead of the AI Curve

**Key Features:**
- Designed by Google experts
- Hands-on activities based on real-world scenarios

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created New Original Course Module

**Module ID:** `module-ai-fundamentals-intro`  
**Title:** "Introduction to AI Fundamentals"  
**Type:** Interactive (internal content)  
**Price:** Free

This is **original educational content** created for the LitmusAI platform, NOT the official Google AI Essentials course.

**Module ID:** `module-google-ai-essentials`  
**Title:** "Google AI Essentials"

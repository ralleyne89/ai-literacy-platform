## ❌ Courses Without Content

### Why They Appear Blank

Most training modules in the catalog are **external courses** that link to third-party platforms (Coursera, edX, etc.). They don't have internal lesson content.

**Examples:**
- **Google AI Essentials** → Links to Coursera ($49 course)
- **Elements of AI** → Links to University of Helsinki
- **Prompt Engineering Mastery** → External resource

These modules are designed to:
1. Show course information
2. Provide a "Start Learning" button
3. Redirect users to the external platform

They are **NOT** meant to have internal lessons in the course viewer.

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### For Internal Courses (with lessons)
- ✅ Course viewer loads with sidebar showing all lessons
- ✅ Clicking a lesson displays the content
- ✅ Progress tracking works
- ✅ Navigation between lessons works

### For External Courses (no lessons)
- ✅ Module detail page shows course info
- ✅ "Start Learning" button links to external platform
- ❌ Course viewer shows "No lessons available" (expected)

## 📊 API Endpoint Verification

### Working Endpoints

**Get Lessons:**
```bash
GET /api/course/modules/module-ai-fundamentals-intro/lessons
Response: 200 OK - Returns 7 lessons
```

**Get Lesson Content:**
```bash
GET /api/course/lessons/72bf95cd-71ac-457f-87e4-eba45c52e79c

- ✅ API endpoints return lesson data successfully
- ✅ Frontend displays lessons correctly
- ✅ Navigation between lessons works
- ✅ All lesson types render (text, quiz, interactive)

## 📝 Recommendations

### Option 1: Add More Internal Courses
Create lesson content for other modules:
```bash
cd backend
python3 seeders/course_content.py --force
```

Modify `backend/seeders/course_content.py` to add lessons for:
- Prompt Engineering Mastery
- AI for Business Leaders
- Machine Learning Fundamentals
- etc.

### Option 2: Update UI for External Courses
Improve the course viewer to handle external courses better:
- Show a message: "This course is hosted on [Platform Name]"
- Display a prominent "Go to Course" button
- Show course syllabus/overview from the external platform

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Keep some courses as external links (Google AI Essentials, Elements of AI)
- Create internal content for custom/original courses
- Clearly label which courses are internal vs. external

   - Click "Start Learning"
   - Should open course viewer

### Test External Courses

1. **Navigate to an external course:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/training/modules/module-google-ai-essentials/learn
   ```

2. **Expected behavior:**
   - Course viewer loads but shows no lessons
   - OR shows message "No lessons available"

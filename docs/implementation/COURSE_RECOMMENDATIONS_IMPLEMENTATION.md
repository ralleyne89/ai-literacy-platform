# Course Recommendations & Assessment Results Implementation

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Assessment Results ARE Being Saved** ✅
- Assessment results are already being saved to the database when users complete assessments
- The `/api/assessment/submit` endpoint saves:
  - Overall score
  - Domain-specific scores
  - Timestamp
  - Assessment type/category
  - Recommendations
- Assessment history is retrievable via `/api/assessment/history`

### 2. **New Course Recommendations Endpoint** ✅
- Created `/api/assessment/recommendations` endpoint
- Analyzes user's latest assessment results
- Identifies weak domains (< 50% correct)
- Returns personalized training module recommendations
- Prioritizes modules based on skill gaps

### 3. **Dashboard Course Recommendations UI** ✅
- Updated `DashboardPage.jsx` to fetch and display course recommendations
- Shows up to 6 recommended courses based on assessment results
- Displays:
  - Course title and description
  - Priority badges (High Priority, Recommended)
  - Reason for recommendation (e.g., "Strengthen your AI Fundamentals skills")
  - Duration, difficulty level, premium status
  - "Start Learning" button linking to course

### 4. **Training Module Domain Mapping** ✅
- Added `target_domains` field to `TrainingModule` model
- Updated training seeder to include domain mappings
- Mapped existing modules to assessment domains:
  - AI Fundamentals
  - Practical Usage
  - Ethics & Critical Thinking
  - AI Impact & Applications
  - Strategic Understanding

### 5. **Database Migration Script** ✅
- Created migration to add `target_domains` column to `training_module` table
- Migration script: `backend/run_migration.py`

---

## 🔧 Setup Required

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

The database needs to be updated with the new `target_domains` column:

```bash
cd backend
python3 run_migration.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Successfully added 'target_domains' column to training_module table
✅ Migration complete!
```

### Step 2: Seed Training Modules

Update existing training modules with domain mappings:

```bash
cd backend
python3 seed_modules.py
```

This will update all training modules with their target domains.

### Step 3: Restart Backend Server

After running migrations, restart the backend server to pick up model changes:

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python app.py
```

### Step 4: Test the Implementation

1. **Login to the platform**
2. **Take an assessment** (or use existing assessment results)
3. **Visit the Dashboard** - You should see personalized course recommendations
4. **Click on a recommended course** to start learning

## 📋 How It Works

### Assessment Results Storage

When a user completes an assessment:

1. Frontend sends answers to `/api/assessment/submit`
2. Backend calculates:
   - Total score
   - Domain-specific scores
   - Percentage
   - Score band (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
3. Results are saved to `assessment_result` table with:
   - `user_id`
   - `total_score`, `max_score`, `percentage`
   - `domain_scores` (JSON with scores for each domain)
   - `completed_at` timestamp
   - `recommendations` (JSON with personalized recommendations)

### Course Recommendations Algorithm

When dashboard loads:

1. Frontend calls `/api/assessment/recommendations`
2. Backend:
   - Fetches user's latest assessment result
   - Analyzes `domain_scores` to find weak areas (< 50% correct)
   - Queries training modules that target those weak domains
   - Prioritizes by skill gap percentage
   - Returns top 6 recommendations
3. Frontend displays recommendations with:
   - Priority badges
   - Skill gap information
   - Direct links to start learning

### Domain Mapping

Training modules are mapped to assessment domains:

| Module | Target Domains |
|--------|---------------|
| AI Fundamentals for Sales Teams | Practical Usage, AI Impact & Applications |
| Ethical AI in HR Practices | Ethics & Critical Thinking, AI Impact & Applications |
| AI-Powered Marketing Campaigns | Practical Usage, Strategic Understanding |
| Operational Efficiency with AI | Strategic Understanding, AI Impact & Applications |
| Prompt Engineering Mastery | Practical Usage, AI Fundamentals |
| Google AI Essentials | AI Fundamentals, Practical Usage |
| Elements of AI | AI Fundamentals, Ethics & Critical Thinking |
| IBM SkillsBuild | AI Fundamentals, Practical Usage, Ethics & Critical Thinking |

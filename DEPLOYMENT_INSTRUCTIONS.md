2. Select your project: `sybctfhasyazoryzxjcg`
3. Click Settings (gear icon) ‚Üí API
4. Scroll to "Project API keys"
5. Copy the **service_role** key (NOT the anon key!)

2. Select your project
3. Click SQL Editor (left sidebar)
4. Click "New query"

```sql
-- Add Stripe subscription columns
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS stripe_customer_id TEXT;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS stripe_subscription_id TEXT;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS subscription_status TEXT;

-- Add indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_stripe_customer ON users(stripe_customer_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_stripe_subscription ON users(stripe_subscription_id);

-- Verify columns were added
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'users' 
  AND column_name IN ('stripe_customer_id', 'stripe_subscription_id', 'subscription_status')
ORDER BY column_name;
```

6. Click "Run" (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)
7. Verify you see 3 rows in the results (the new columns)

### Step 3: Add Environment Variable to Netlify (3 min)

   - **Value:** [Paste the service role key from Step 1]
   - **Scopes:** All scopes
6. Click "Create variable"

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you're using the **service_role** key, NOT the anon key!

### Step 4: Verify Stripe Webhook (2 min)

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
2. Click Developers ‚Üí Webhooks
3. Verify you have an endpoint: `https://litmusai.netlify.app/api/webhooks/stripe`
4. If not, click "Add endpoint" and:
   - URL: `https://litmusai.netlify.app/api/webhooks/stripe`
   - Events: Select these 6 events:
     - `checkout.session.completed`
     - `customer.subscription.created`
     - `customer.subscription.updated`
     - `customer.subscription.deleted`
     - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
     - `invoice.payment_failed`
   - Click "Add endpoint"
5. Copy the webhook signing secret (starts with `whsec_`)
6. Verify it matches the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Netlify environment variables

### Step 5: Deploy (2 min)

```bash
# Commit the fixes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Stripe payment integration - resolve database schema and webhook issues"

# Push to your branch
git push origin feat/phase2-auth-dashboard
```

Netlify will automatically deploy. Wait for the build to complete (~2-3 minutes).

### Step 6: Test (3 min)

1. Go to https://litmusai.netlify.app/billing
2. Click "Upgrade to Premium"
3. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Expiry: Any future date (e.g., 12/25)
   - CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
   - ZIP: Any 5 digits (e.g., 12345)
4. Complete checkout
5. You should be redirected to `/billing?success=true`
6. Verify success message appears

### Step 7: Verify Database (2 min)

1. Go back to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run this query:

```sql
SELECT 
  email,
  subscription_tier,
  stripe_customer_id,
  stripe_subscription_id,
  subscription_status
FROM users
WHERE stripe_customer_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY updated_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

3. You should see your test user with:
   - `subscription_tier` = "premium"
   - `stripe_customer_id` = "cus_..." (starts with cus_)
   - `stripe_subscription_id` = "sub_..." (starts with sub_)
   - `subscription_status` = "active"
